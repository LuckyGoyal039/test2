        <p><strong>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam(A.P.J Abdul kalam)</strong>, (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram,
            India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian scientist and 11<sup>th</sup> president who played a leading
            role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs.</p>
        <p>Kalam earned a degree in
            <a href="https://www.collegedekho.com/courses/btech-aeronautical-engineering/#:~:text=Aeronautical%20engineering%20is%20a%20field,such%20as%20airplanes%20and%20helicopters."
                target="_blank">aeronautical engineering</a>
            from the
            <a href="https://www.mitindia.edu/en/" target="_blank">Madras Institute of Technology</a>
            and in 1958 joined the <a href="https://www.drdo.gov.in/home"
                title="Defence Research and Development Organisation">DRDO</a>.
            In 1969 he moved to the <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/" titile="Indian Space Research Organisation"
                target="_blank">ISRO</a>,
            where he was project director of the
            <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/launchers/slv" target="_blank"
                title="Satellite Launch Vehicle-3">SLV-III</a>, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both
            designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of
            successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname <strong>Missile Man</strong>. Among those successes
            was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agni_(missile)#searchInput" target="_blank">Agni</a>, India’s
            first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in
            1989.
            From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the
            <strong>defense minister</strong>
            , and he later served as
            <strong>principal scientific adviser (1999–2001)</strong>
            to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the country’s 1998
            <strong>nuclear weapons</strong>
            tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests
            caused great concern in the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community#:~:text=The%20international%20community%2C%20is%20a,or%20states%20in%20the%20world."
                target="_blank">international community</a>. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called
            Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a
            developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural
            productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care
            and education.
        </p>
        <p>In
            <strong>2002</strong>
            India’s ruling
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance" target="blank">National Democratic
                Alliance (NDA)</a> put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing
            President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._R._Narayanan" target="blank"
                title="Kocheril Raman Narayanan">K.R Narayanan</a>.
            Kalam was nominated by the
            <strong><a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva#:~:text=According%20to%20Merriam%2DWebster's%20Encyclopedia,this%20'Hindu%2Dness'."
                    target="blank">Hindu nationalist (Hindutva)</a> NDA even though he was Muslim</strong>, and his
            stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the
            <a href="https://www.inc.in/" target="blank">Indian National Congress</a>
            , also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as <strong>India’s 11th
                president</strong>, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his term in
            2007 and was succeeded by
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratibha_Patil" target="blank">Pratibha Patil</a>, the country’s
            <strong>first woman president</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Upon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed to using science and technology to transform India
            into a developed country and served as a lecturer at several universities.
            <strong>On July 27, 2015, he collapsed while delivering a lecture at the <a
                    href="https://www.iimshillong.ac.in/" target="blank" title="Indian Institute of Management">IIM
                    Shillong</a> and was pronounced dead from cardiac arrest soon afterward</strong>. Kalam wrote
            several books, including an autobiography, <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wings_of_Fire_(autobiography)" target="blank">Wings of Fire</a>
            (1999). Among his numerous awards were two of the country’s highest honours, the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padma_Bhushan" target="blank">Padma Vibhushan</a> (1990) and the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Ratna" target="blank">Bharat Ratna</a> (1997).
